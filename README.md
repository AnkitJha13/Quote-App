Click the "New Quote" button to fetch and display another random quote.
The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dynamically update the quote without requiring a page refresh.

## Customization
You can easily customize the appearance and behavior of the Random Quote Generator.

- To change the styling, modify the CSS file (styles.css) as per your requirements.
- If you want to use a different set of quotes, open the script.js file and update the quotes array with your desired quotes. Each quote should be an object with a quote property containing the quote text and an optional author property for the quote's author.
